# Apache Flink SQL Cookbook

 The [Apache Flink SQL](https://docs.ververica.com/user_guide/sql_development/index.html) Cookbook is a curated collection of examples, patterns, and use cases of Apache Flink SQL. 
 Many of the recipes are completely self-contained and can be run in [Ververica Platform](https://docs.ververica.com/index.html) as is.

The cookbook is a living document. 
The first twenty-four examples are being added as an advent calendar leading up to Christmas 2020.
